<!-- The README that will appear on the package's NPM page: https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-edit-react
On publish, this file is temporarily renamed to the main README so it gets published to npm,
then renamed back to this file, so the primary README remains published to Github repo.

The {{BLOCKS}} below are replaced from the equivalent blocks in the main README file when the
`yarn prepareReadme` script is run (which also happens before publish).
