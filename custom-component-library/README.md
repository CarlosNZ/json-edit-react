A collection of [Custom Components](https://github.com/CarlosNZ/json-edit-react#custom-nodes) for **json-edit-react**. 

A work in progress.

Contains a [Vite](https://vite.dev/) web-app for previewing and developing components.

The individual components are in the `/components` folder, along with demo data (in `data.ts`).

## Components

These are the ones I'm planning for now:

- [x] Hyperlink/URL
- [x] Undefined
- [x] Date Object
- [x] Date/Time Picker (with ISO string)
- [x] Boolean Toggle
- [ ] `NaN`
- [ ] BigInt

## Development

From within this folder: `/custom-component-library`:

Install dependencies:

```js
yarn install
```

Launch app:

```js
yarn dev
```
