/**
 * Filter-state slice: surfaces the pre-computed `{ visiblePaths,
 * visibleChildCounts }` from `JsonEditor` to every node, so per-node
 * visibility/count is an O(1) Set/Map lookup instead of the per-node
 * subtree walk the old `filterNode` did.
 *
 * Three consumer hooks:
 *
 *   useFilterActive()           — boolean: "is search active right now?"
 *                                 Drives the n-of-m branch (no point
 *                                 saying "5 of 5" when nothing's filtered).
 *
 *   useNodeVisible(path)        — boolean: "should this node render?"
 *                                 Replaces both per-node `filterNode`
 *                                 calls. Returns `true` when no filter
 *                                 is active.
 *
 *   useVisibleChildCount(path)  — number | null: visible direct children
 *                                 of this collection. `null` when no
 *                                 filter is active (caller falls back to
 *                                 `nodeData.size`).
 *
 * Pattern note: this is a dumb provider — `JsonEditor` owns the
 * `useMemo` that builds the state, and passes it as a `value` prop.
 * Keeps the algorithm out of React-land for testability (see
 * `computeFilterState` in `utils/filter.ts`) and means the context
 * value's identity is stable between search keystrokes (only changes
 * when `(data, searchText, searchFilter)` change), so the §16 memo
 * invariants hold for everything below.
